# How did we calculate this
Instead of writing a full scale generator for the (salary) date, I decided to
do it manually but document it here (Peleg).

## calculator_salary.json
The main body of data here is the `table` list.
Each entry in this table refers to a "teken".
Each teken entry is an ordered dict, with the following items
* name (Hebrew)
* group: this is 1 for any teken that is not mmh (מורה מן החוץ)
* havraaDays: this is a dictionary pointing from number of years to number of
  days.  The keys should be strings (not sure why).  The first key must be "0".
* pulses: this is a list of "pulses", each corresponds to the salary components
  starting from a given date.

The pulses have the following keys:
* date: the start date of the pulse, in the format "YYYY-MM-DD".  The first
  pulse should be somewhere in 2014 (previous cla).
* Then there should be entries A,B,C,D,E,F,G (which I'll explain below).
* We should not forget about "mipuy peimot".

For the numbers corresponding to the entries A,B,C,D,E,F,G and how to obtain
these from the salary tables:
* A is "meshulav 2014".  It is given in the ifyun file.
* B is obtained from the tables.  For the first pulse (2014), it should be
  zero.  For later pulses it is obtained by looking at the "meshulav" column at
  vetek 0, and substracting A.
* C is the "vetek shikli".  It is given in the ifyun file.
* D is the academic extra.  It is given in the ifyun file.
* E is the calculation result of B * 0.176466809421842.  Don't ask me why.
  Result of some reverse engineering.
* F is the maximal vetek (in years).  It is given in the ifyun file (perhaps
  not for maslul makbil)
* G is only for mmh, and it is given (as is) in the tables.
* H is value of Havraa day

Note that "עוזר הוראה ב" is "עוזר הוראה 32".
